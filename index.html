    <p><strong>Notice</strong><br>
    As of <strong>24/1/2026</strong>, the file hosting service at
    <strong>https://love.wvxx.dpdns.org/</strong> is entering end of life.</p>

    <p>
    Due to ongoing abuse, spam, and repeated malicious activity, it has become no longer feasible
    to continue operating the service for the small number of legitimate users. Multiple parties
    have persistently attacked and misused the platform, making proper moderation and monitoring
    impractical.
    </p>

    <p>
    Effective immediately, new file uploads and file creation will be disabled. This decision was
    not made lightly, but is necessary to prevent further abuse and to protect the server
    infrastructure.
    </p>

    <p>
    Existing files will not be impacted and will continue to function as intended for the
    foreseeable future.
    </p>

    <p>
    If there are any questions or concerns, please contact the service administrator through the
    appropriate channel.
    </p>

    <p>
    Thank you to everyone who used <strong>love.wvxx.dpdns.org</strong> and for the different ways
    the service has been used over time.
